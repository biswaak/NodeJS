Introduction
************
    - NodeJS is the Server Side Scripting Language.

    - NodeJS, used to implete the Servers.

            Http Server

            TCP Server

    - we will implement Node Applications in two ways.

        1) JavaScript

        2) TypeScript
    
    - JavaScript is the Scripting Language and won't supports OOPS.

    - TypeScript is the Programming Language and supports OOPS.

    - we will implement the servers by using either "predefined" or "3rd" party libraries


1) http

    - http library used to develop the http servers.


2) fs

    - fs stands for file system

    - fs module, used to interact with the "flat files".

    Ex
        XML files

        JSON files

        Text Files


3) express

    - express is the "framework".

    - express framework used to develop the restful services.

    Ex.
        GET
        POST
        PUT
        DELETE
        PATCH


4) mysql

    - used to interact with the mysql database.


5) mssql

    - used to connect to SQLServer.


6) mongodb & mongoose

    - either mongodb or mongoose used to connect to mongodb database.

    - mongodb module will connect to mongodb database without "schema"

    - mongoose module will connect to mongodb database with "Schema".

    - Schema means rules and regulations.


6) cors

    - used to enable the CORS Policy.

    - enabling communication between different ports called as cors policy.

7) body-parser

    - used to receive the data from client application


8) jwt-simple / jsonwebtoken

    - used to generate the tokens.

    - in general, we will use these tokens for authentication purpose.

    - this authentication called as token based authentication.


9) multer

    - used to upload the images to the server.


10) socket.io

    - used to implement the chat applications
